# HUBBLE
This is a project that was done in group between myself and another cfg(code first girl) student accomplished together. 
It is not highly functional like Netflix or HBO Max but it shows how we used our 5 weeks of lessons to bring an idea to life in just 3 weeks. 
This project was fun to create as i got to work in a team while seeing actual code come to life
I am greatful for all that i learnt in my 8 weeks in the web-dev class of cfg from but my instructuers and classmate
